Welcome to the Planning Commission meeting for Salt Lake City Planning Commission on October 9th
11:05
2024 it's 5:30 pm. um the you can see we have five

11:30
uh my name is Amy Burrows I'm the chair of the Planning Commission for this year and I have a couple things I wanted to
11:35
recognize um yesterday in the Salt Lake County Council passed a resolution with
11:42
a commitment to preserve a brenel hall in its current form and at its current
11:47
site so that may be something that's interesting to this um group as we've talked about AB brael hell a lot lately
11:54
recognizing it's not a city asset but it still is part of the fabric of our
11:59
City also the Utah Hockey Club had its inaugural game last night which
12:05
um they won 5 to2 so that was an exciting event that was um downtown in
12:10
salake city does the vice chairperson have anything to report I have nothing
12:16
to report thank you great now it's time for the report of the planning
12:22
director I don't have anything to report tonight either thank
12:27
you okay thank you um now it's time for an open Forum which is a time where the Commissioners may
12:33
discuss planning zoning and general land use items that are not listed on the agenda this is limited to 10 minutes and
12:39
does not include a public discussion do any Commissioners have anything to
12:47
discuss no okay thank you we'll move to the consent agenda so there are two
12:55
items on our consent agenda tonight the first is a request for conditional use for The Other Side Academy adult daycare
13:02
at approximately 630 East 100 South that case number is pln PCM
13:16
2024-25 West 300 North and that case number is pln PCM 2024
13:23
006 31
13:32
I'm going to open the public hearing for those two items if anyone wants to speak on either of those items that I just
13:38

13:45
comment or if there are any new comments that re we received since the reports were published
13:53
no okay I'm going to close the public hearing for those two items
13:59
um it's now time for a discussion among the count commission or a
14:07
motion I'll make a motion so I move that we accept the consent agendum items one
14:12
and two I'll second okay we have a motion from
14:20
commissioner Barry and a second from commissioner Scott any discussion to that motion okay
14:27
we're going to vote on it so we'll have um commissioner Kik
14:35
yes commissioner Scott yes commissioner Barry yes commissioner Gail
14:43
yes and I will also vote Yes so that the consent agenda passes
14:52
unanimously so thank you
15:06
okay the first item on our regular agenda is a text amendment to permit outdoor theaters in the CG General
15:13
commercial District this is case number pln
15:20
PCM 20245 95 the planner planner is Noah
15:26
elore you want to present the project to us thank you
15:33
Commissioners so let me just set all this up really quick um I have some
15:41
vested interest in this uh text Amendment so I'm going to recuse myself from this agenda item there's a quorum
15:48
with four so I'm gonna step out really quick okay thank you commissioner kic will
15:56
leave the room while we discuss and vote on this item
16:06
all right so at their formal meeting on May 7th
16:11
2024 silic city council initiated a petition to research and draft an ordinance to permit live performance
16:18
theaters either indoor or outdoor within the CG General commercial district and
16:24
any other District that may be appropriate based on intensity scale and location
16:29
currently only indoor live performance theaters are permitted based on a code provision stipulating all business
16:35
activity shall be conducted wholly within an enclosed building unless specifically specified
16:42
otherwise staff will be recommending a positive recommendation to city council concerning this
16:48
amendment so the details to start the proposal includes
16:53
revising the definition of live performance theaters to allow for either indoor or outdoor use the revised
17:01
definition you can see there has been streamlined as well to remove excess or
17:06
Superfluous language just to make it a little easier and more readily uh
17:12
comprehensible from there the land use tables were updated to add the live outdoor live performance theor use and
17:18
distinguish it from the existing indoor live performance theater use
17:24
specifically the land use tables were revised for the CG G GMU OS pl2 and all
17:32
downtown districts those districts either already have live performance
17:37
theaters as a permitted use or the similar formal Amphitheater use for
17:43
outdoor live performance theaters in the CG GMU and downtown districts a footnote
17:49
will be attached prohibiting the use within a th000 fet of any residential
17:55
district that prohibition is based on District as opposed to to use currently
18:01
live performance theaters which will now become indoor live performance theaters specifically uh have a footnote attached
18:07
prohibiting the use within a th000 feet of a single or two family zoning District this footnote will remain in
18:14
place and will be clarified to prohibit the use specifically on Lots within 1,000
18:21
ft so here's a breakdown of the subject districts which currently permit live performance theaters and which currently
18:27
permit formal amphitheaters the outdoor live performance theater use will be replacing the instances of formal
18:33
theater amphitheaters in those use uh districts these districts were all
18:38
chosen based on the expected intensity of uh existing uses and the anticipated
18:44
intensity of the outdoor theaters so for example the purpose statement of the CG
18:49
District notes this District provides Economic Development opportunities through a mix of land uses including
18:55
among other things entertainment uses for those districts with the formal Amphitheater use that use is similar to
19:01
an outdoor theater already so the anticipated use is therefore expect to
19:06
be similar with that in mind as the formal Amphitheater use has no footnote currently attached to it in the way that
19:13
the indoor live performance theaters do no no footnote is proposed for the OS
19:20
and pl2 districts you may notice the GMU I didn't mention that that's because
19:25
live performance theater already permitted in GMU with that footnote so we will be attaching that footnote for
19:32
outdoor life performance theaters in the GMU and then just to confirm live
19:39
performance indoor live performance theaters aren't included in this proposal this is exclusively related to
19:45
outdoor so then I just have some maps here I know this is kind of big picture and maybe a little hard to see the finer
19:51
details but this just shows Citywide and green there this the open space And Then There are the other districts the
19:57
hatched area is the buffer so then just to zoom in on the more populated area
20:03
you can see our downtown districts sort of on the East there with the GMU in the
20:08
Northwest and the CG in red the you'll notice the hatched area does not apply
20:13
to the green OS districts that's because the buffer does not apply there and you
20:19
may notice that hatched light blue color along the east of downtown that's the pl2 district so it also does not have
20:26
the buffer and then here is just to highlight those Parcels which will permit the outdoor live performance
20:33
theater you can see those sort of bolded here and then as you may be aware of the
20:39
ongoing zoning consolidation here's what that map will look like post
20:46
consolidation so for the mu6 mu8 and mu1
20:51
those districts are corresponding to our General commercial district and other districts which permit indoor live
20:58
performance cers currently and so you can see those in the lighter green sort
21:03
of in the Northwest that's mu6 the lighter blue is
21:09
mu8 and this purple running north south where the CG is presently is
21:15
mu1 the hatched areas in red represent areas where that buffer will no longer
21:21
apply following the consolidation so it sort of clears out a little by the
21:26
University of Utah and sort of East Central Downtown and just to note this map is
21:33
subject to change as the process is ongoing um public process
21:39
included uh the petition sending out the 45-day required noticing to the recognized Community organizations
21:46
posting online openhouse and posting uh the notice of the public hearing we did
21:52
received some public comments concerning noise and that is related to that expans
21:58
buffer to apply to all residential districts uh in contrast to the existing buffer being a little more limited we
22:05
expanded it based on the information discussed staff recommends that the Planning
22:10
Commission forward a positive recommendation to the city council any
22:17
questions is is there an applicant in this process or is was it initiated by the sake city council councilman puy
22:25
okay
22:31
do you have any clarifying questions this is not time to discuss the merits of this um request but just to clarify
22:40
anything no okay thank you I'm going
22:45
to open the public hearing if anyone wants to speak on this request or this
22:51
item you can approach the
22:57
podium no or any new comments thank you I'm going to close
23:03
the public hearing then and now we'll be an executive session so that the members of the
23:09
Planning Commission can discuss this request discuss or make a
23:21
motion um no I just want to clarify I mean I know the answer but let's put it on the record that this ordinance
23:27
doesn't super proceed the the noise ordinance by Salt Lake County that's set
23:33
they still have to follow those rules yes correct my I have a question um because
23:41
the staff report references a conversation that we had previously that um did where we were concerned that some
23:48
activities were allowed were not allowed within single or two family residences
23:55
but were allowed in larger uh residents uses and I wonder
24:02
if there was there was some comment to that in the report but why is it how do
24:07
we how do we see that in how do we see that concerning Equity
24:12
where these won't be allowed within like a duplex or a single family residence but would be allowed by a Triplex or a
24:20
for Plex so I think um that goes to what you're looking at in the district so for
24:27
instance we expanded the offer to Target all residential districts those are those districts that are intended for
24:33
those residential focused uses when we're looking at downtown CG those are where we expect high-intensity uses such
24:41
as this in fact we're seeing similar uses are already present like the already existing indoor live performance
24:48
theaters so these districts are designed for these high-intensity uses that's
24:53
what you would expect to see in these districts why are we
25:00
I feel like if um if a use is allowed within a th000 feet of a fourplex then
25:07
maybe it should be allowed within a th000 ft of a single family home or a
25:13
duplex and that's this would be the time to change that that language at this
25:19
time I I recognize that you're a
25:25
allowing um not all allowing an
25:30
outdoor theater within a th000 ft of any kind of residential district is that
25:35
right correct but maintaining that you can't have an indoor Live Theater within
25:41
a th000 feet over a single family home or a duplex so as I mentioned indoor live performance theaters are out of the
25:47
scope of this proposal so that's not something we were looking at this was specifically about outdoor live
25:53
performance theaters it is you are changing though the language that references the distance from
26:02
a like on let's see on attachment a it talks about table of permitted and
26:08
conditional uses for residential districts you are changing the
26:15
qualifying provision for that for indoor
26:21
live performance theaters so I wouldn't say we're changing it but rather we're clarifying it to apply to Lots as
26:27
opposed to uses so you may recall that discussion with the concrete manufacturing batch plant
26:33
right so this clarifies it applies to the lot specifically as opposed to the use it's much more readily identifiable
26:39
based on the lot as opposed to if we base it on the use then we have to look at every single parcel within a th000
26:46
feet of the proposal and that's not feasible right that was I I
26:53
remember that conversation and part of that conversation was that we we felt like we should reconsider the designation
27:00
between single and two family zoning districts and that's what the proposal
27:07
does it goes from just the existing single or two family to all residential districts so for example when you're
27:13
looking at that residential District's table it's all of those
27:19
districts but note 13 is still there on that on that specific table that
27:24
qualifying provision number 13 is still there yes because it's for the indoor live performance Theater which you'll
27:31
see are conditional use for RB rmu 35 there are still some other
27:38
districts which have Indo indoor live performance theater as a conditional use
27:44
so that footnote will remain for the indoor use right that's which is out my
27:51
point is that if we're but it it's it's kind of in the scope of work because it's we're addressing that provisional
27:59
that qualifying provision but maybe I'm the only one who has that concern but it does I I wish that we would fix all of
28:07
those at the same time since we're considering it but made that clear
28:14
so if there's no discussion I'm ready to make a
28:20
motion okay based on the information presented in the discussion for pln PCM 202 24-
28:30
595 text amendment to permit outdoor live performance theaters I move that the commission forward a recommendation
28:37
to adopt this text Amendment to the city council I'll
28:43
second okay that's a motion by commissioner Barry and a second by commissioner
28:49
Gail um commissioner Scott yes commissioner
28:56
Barry yes commissioner Gail yes and I also will vote Yes so that's unanimous
29:02
will forward a positive recommendation to ad adopt that text Amendment thank you for your time thank
29:15
you I think we're Gathering commissioner Kik back thank you
29:30
sure no that's correct commissioner kic has returned um
29:36
our next item and on the regular agenda is The Granary District area
29:45
plan and the planner is Laura mclen
30:17
not sorry better um it's been a minute um yeah I'm
30:23
Laura mclen with the transportation division um and I was the PM on the grany district plan and this plan it's
30:31
an areawide multimodal circulation plan um again led by the transportation
30:36
Division and this was funded by a grant from the wasach front Regional Council through their transportation
30:41
land TLC program um and the goal of the plan was to recommend Transportation
30:48
solutions to increase connectivity safety and comfort for all Road
30:54
users um the plan recommended a aable approvement sort of like short-term and
31:00
Midterm projects that could be uh seek funding for and implemented um in a in a
31:07
2 to 10 year time frame um and the goal of this plan was just to identify high
31:12
level Concepts um that the transportation division could reference when seeking funding for different
31:18
projects in the area um this also relates to several
31:25
adopted plans within the city um the recent recently adopted city-wide Transportation plan
31:31
um it will work towards several of the key moves um from that plan for example
31:38
there was create safer streets improve pedestrian safety and connectivity expand low stress biking net bicycling
31:44
networks and micromobility options promote connectivity at the Block Level to create walkable districts and use
31:51
Street typologies to guide complete streets development um the downtown plan back in 2016
31:58
references the wide streets with relatively few cars provide opportunities for a new way of thinking
32:04
about our streets as public spaces that provide space for movement and public gathering and that was something that we
32:09
thought about as we were developing this plan and something that um some property owners and developers are also open to
32:15
repurposing the ride of way to serve more of a public function um plan Salt Lake from 2015
32:22
also had some of those key moves in regards to neighborhoods growth Transportation air quality beautiful
32:28
city equity and economy and then the Salt Lake City pedestrian and bicycle master plan also seeks to integrate
32:35
walking and bicycling into Community planning and you know again develop a safe comfortable and attractive walking
32:40
and bicycling Network um just to give a brief overview
32:47
of the public engagement that was conducted during this plan's development um the graner district
32:53
Alliance was really integral to connecting with the the local business
32:58
Community residents in the area developers as well um they were really fantastic to work with and they were
33:04
super helpful in helping us connect with all of those different parties um the consultant team and the
33:11
and the city project manager participated in the Huda Fest event um in October
33:19
2023 um where we interacted with I think over 200 people had a
33:28
uh printed map where folks could leave points of uh conflict or things that
33:33
they wanted the project team to take into consideration when we were thinking about the district um so received over
33:39
150 comments during that event and then on the virtual side we had a survey with
33:46
an interactive map as well um and received 72 full responses to the survey and another 26 comments left on the
33:53
interactive map and then we also had a community event for Granary District businesses
33:59
and developers that was held at industry SLC in December and 36 different
34:05
businesses and developers attended that event um and it was to provide input on The Granary District area plan and also
34:11
the TechLink track study that um there will be a new rail reactivated through the area and so got feedback from 36
34:19
different business owners and developers during that
34:24
event so for the plan itself we used the Salt Lake City street typologies design
34:31
guide um as sort of the foundation to look at the area we looked at the
34:37
assigned Street typologies for each Street within the study area and said okay what does it look like to implement
34:43
the typologies as is and then going from there identifying the barriers that we might run into if we were going to do
34:50
that and what would need to be adjusted for each of the typologies um a few of the barriers that
34:57
we identified were parking or Flex Zones and this was um you know maybe
35:04
identified as a barrier if available parking was located in areas where like a flex zone might be a better fit um in
35:11
other words maybe a potential parking reduction in the future um non-motorized facilities are behind the curb we're
35:18
identified if it might difficult to implement the recommended bik or pedestrian facilities or placem areas um
35:26
if they were restricted by the existing ride of way you know what might have to be taken away or um some compromises
35:32
made some tradeoffs um depending on the existing rideway and then along the same
35:38
lines right of way and curb to curb um were evaluated as a barrier if a lane
35:44
reduction might be required to implement the recommended Street typology which would just cause a need for a more
35:50
substantial um you know reconstruction of the corridor of the ride of way um
35:55
but that was uh again planning level purposes only there was no engineering design done at this stage and then
36:02
finally utilities and tree canopy um did a lot of work in tandem with the public
36:07
utilities department um and also considering the like the major transmission lines that
36:13
are present in some of the the study area old railroad infrastructure um that
36:18
might pose challenges to implementing the assigned street typology so again this was just sort of showing what those
36:24
barriers might be not saying that any of them are insurmountable but just calling those out as a starting
36:32
point then what we did moving into recommendations um was uh identify
36:41
intersection improvements so spot gaps where are there uncomfortable Crossings for bikes pedestrians people walking or
36:47
rolling through the area um Network gaps which were identifying opportunities for
36:54
maybe New midblock connections there's so much new development going in in the
37:00
area and potential opportunities to integrate some of those midblock connections um some of the developers
37:06
are already doing that with their projects making sure that they have pedestrian connections going through the
37:12
middle of their sometimes block sized projects um and then just Corridor
37:19
recommendations um and we called out a few specific ones uh we called them
37:24
catalytic corridors um focusing on what doesn't
37:30
overlap with other projects that will be coming in on this map you can see like fifth West was not identified as one of
37:36
these because that will be considered during the green Loop planning process and so we didn't want to duplicate
37:42
efforts um but looking at sixth West as an opportunity 8th South and fourth West
37:48
as well um and what we did after
37:53
identifying those specific intersection and corridors um was put everything into a
38:01
priority projects
38:06
Matrix that had a lot of different factors that went into um into the prioritization and
38:13
including cost utility impacts um user Comfort maintenance
38:19
impacts um enhancements to the non-motorized network um and and a few a few you know
38:26
is this Improvement complex to construct um trying to identify things that could be accomplished in the near term versus
38:33
the Midterm um and so you know you can see on the Matrix to the right here there
38:41
are different spot projects Network projects and Corridor projects that were identified as near-term or midterm and
38:47
so not every potential Improvement was recommended as part of this Suite of
38:52
projects um just because they may be longer term or more major
38:57
major projects that would uh be more complex to implement in sort of the intended time frame for this
39:05
plan sorry wrong computer um and so moving forward thinking about taking action again we
39:12
had just high level concept design examples for each of the priority corridors um fourth West Sixth West and
39:19
8th South and moving forward um you know the transportation division would be
39:25
able to use those highle Concepts to identify potential funding sources and see how these suggestions these
39:31
recommendations might align with other upcoming Transportation projects and how we could fit these recommendations to um
39:38
our you know funding applications moving forward and then also trying to stay aligned with all of the development that
39:44
is happening in the area and the developer Community is also very interested in seeing improvements within
39:49
the right of way as well as on those public or sorry private Parcels that they're developing as well um and as I
39:56
mentioned there are several other pretty large projects that are ongoing in development uh that intersect with the
40:02
study area as well you have green Loop um TechLink which is moving forward into
40:10
um selecting a preferred alternative from UTA and then that will that will move forward into more design and environmental so that's moving forward
40:16
and then finally the fleet block is also going to be an important factor when trying to figure out timing and how to
40:22
implement and how to leverage funding in the implementation of this plan
40:27
so thank you thank
40:33
you um do any Commissioners have a clarifying question right
40:39
now no okay thank you I'm going to open a public comment period if you want to
40:47
speak on this project you can approach the
40:55
microphone I don't see anyone so I'll close the public comment
41:03
period and it's open for discussion among the planning
41:17
Commissioners when I looked at this plan in this neighborhood there are know there are not any schools inside the
41:25
inside this uh the borders of this neighborhood but there probably are um
41:31
unless every kid who lives there is bust to a to a
41:38
school did you consider like safe walking routes with among the schools and stuff like that that's a good
41:44
question um that was not something that I didn't call out specific community
41:49
centers or things like schools I think the intent was that eventually this plan
41:55
plan if implemented you would have safe walking infrastructure for the entire District um and to be clear there are
42:03
some major barriers leaving the district um you have major UD do streets fifth and sixth South and then West Temple as
42:10
well um and that's actually one that I should have mentioned on this ongoing projects uh list is that the grand
42:17
boulevards study will be kicking off fairly soon and so taking more of a look at those fifth and sixth South corridors
42:25
um and hopefully creating some again High concept designs for improving um walking and biking conditions north
42:31
south um but the goal of this plan would certainly be to have safe walking routes
42:38
within the within the district there's lots of missing sidewalks and so those would ideally be constructed um and
42:44
again having where possible like safe and separated bicycle infrastructure as
42:50
well um so that was how we were how we were looking at it rather you know just the the whole picture and really trying
42:56
to improve conditions all the way around and not calling out specific destinations thank
43:04
you I really love this plan I think that there it's potentially bringing a lot of
43:10
really great stuff to this neighborhood that really really needs it um one of the questions that I kind of have is um
43:17
your kind of short-term and Midterm um they seem really short that
43:24
seems like very soon um so so how um do you think there is a like the like
43:34
pursuing funding moving forward is something that the report kind of like States is that um is it realistic are
43:42
those like short-term goals realistic with in the framework that you've seen
43:48
yeah no I think that's a great question and probably two years is a little too ambitious on that um I do think the
43:54
transportation division has been exploring more quick opportunities um and just doing some of
44:00
those short-term temporary installations to immediately provide better safe conditions um for folks walking and
44:06
walking and biking um and then I think that some of the more you
44:14
know we've done a lot of a lot of corridor reconstructions over the city lately um and I think that we do have
44:21
some opportunities especially on 8 South um like some restriping opportunities maybe before reconstruct so um I I like
44:29
to think of it as the potential for phased implementations and so maybe again like a little too ambitious for
44:35
the the full implementation within that time frame but I think that we could see pieces and especially leveraging that
44:40
developer connection and where at least several of the developers have indicated uh an interest in partnering having a
44:47
public private partnership on some of those improvements I think that that could really help catalyze some of those quicker improvements and might make them
44:54
more possible in this particular neighborhood then maybe they would be otherwise okay cool yeah I think that
45:01
that um that element is like I'm I love love
45:07
love to see all of it and I just don't want to like create false expectations that there's the super short time frame
45:14
but sounds like there's a lot of stuff going on and uh a lot of it's going to
45:19
be achievable so that's great thanks thank you
45:28

45:35

45:42
recommendation to the city council to adopt The Granary District area plan I'll

46:23
much okay the next item on our um agenda is a
46:29
briefing which does not include a public comment um period the Fair Park zoning
46:37
amendments at approximately 1500 West North Temple this is case number pln PCM
46:43
2024 00982 um and I'll ask the planner and
46:49
presenters to introduce themselves
47:01
hi um Amanda Roman Urban designer and the planning division thank you for
47:07
having us um today I'll do a briefing on a proposed text Amendment which is uh
47:12
called the Jordan River Fair Park zoning
47:19
District a little project background um the area on the screen is the subject
47:24
property which consists of about 38 Parcels um and covers 993 Acres uh Snell
47:30
and Wilmer uh representing Larry H Miller is proposing to create a new zoning District in the Fair Park
47:35
neighborhood to facilitate its Redevelopment um the Jordan River Fair
47:41
Park District is part of a newly established Utah Fair Park area investment and restoration District
47:48
which was created this year by House Bill 562 the eair district aims to
47:53
develop a walkable mixed use neighborhood centered around the Jordan River and in the Utah Fair Park the
47:58
vision includes revitalizing the river rezoning for redevelopment which is the proposal um in front of you and
48:05
potentially attracting a major league baseball team to um this location the plans also feature retail entertainment
48:12
housing and employment opportunities the bill requires that Salt Lake City enter
48:17
and the applicant enter into an agreement by December 31st of this year um or development within this uh
48:25
District would not be subject to to any of our zoning regulations so the purpose of this
48:32
briefing is uh to discuss the proposal gain feedback from you and then uh we
48:40
will return at the next Planning Commission hearing uh to make a recommendation and move this forward to
48:46
the city council so I just want to start by saying um here are two renderings from
48:52
the Power District uh website that we pulled the city is supportive of redeveloping the site into a mixed use
48:59
uh neighborhood aimed at attracting uh this MLB team while City staff is fully
49:04
align with the vision which also meets the goals of the North Temple Boulevard plan uh we do seek assurances that this
49:11
vision is clearly represented within a reg regulatory framework this could be incorporated into the zoning ordinance
49:18
which we'll discuss today or the development agreement which you'll uh be reviewing in more detail at the next
49:25
meeting um um so the staff feedback in this presentation um are just
49:31
suggestions on how to modify the proposed uh Jordan River Fair Park District zoning ordinance to make sure
49:37
the regulations are clear and can be referenced as the site redevelops uh currently the term sheet
49:43
you do have the uh draft in your staff report but the term sheet and our review
49:48
comments is with are with the uh mayor's office and they'll be sent to the
49:53
applicant and work through um hopefully by the next meeting if not then um prior to moving forward to the city council uh
50:00
and the term sheet may include additional details on how to establish development regulations that support the O overall vision of the Power District
50:07
um the applicant is here today and can provide more information on how the zoning and the term sheet will further
50:13
these goals so just quickly go over the um jff
50:20
District regulations so the purpose of the district is to revitalize the Jordan River Implement the house bill which
50:27
established the Utah Fair Fair Park area investment and restoration District
50:32
provide for a mix of uses and then generate uh Economic Development increase employment
50:38
opportunities uh the applicability of the plan of the zoning ordinance uh
50:44
states that the uh properties within the jrf district are not subject to um any
50:51
of the city's adopted plans this would include the North Temple Boulevard plan although the redel velopment is
50:57
supported within that plan uh state-owned land is not subject to any City imposed regulations and they are
51:03
proposing to be exempt from the riparian corridor overlay and the airport flight path protection overlay um the riparian
51:11
corridor overlay essentially just establishes uh development regulations for properties with 100 ft of the of a
51:19
riparian corridor and uh the overlay is intended to achieve a reasonable balance
51:24
between the natural environment and uh Redevelopment and then the air airport
51:30
flat flight path overlay um establishes regulations for properties near the
51:37
airport so the proposed zoning I'll go through each section of their proposed zoning ordinance uh the first section
51:42
speaks to setbacks in open space The Proposal um does not include any setback
51:47
uh building setbacks including no setback from the Jordan River uh the open space uh regulations they are
51:56
proposing that no open space would be required on individual Parcels or Lots
52:01
but the uh language does say that they will use uh open space areas and
52:07
Pathways to facilitate pedestrian use although the um the code itself does not have
52:12
specifics uh staff feedback so uh both planning and public lands are requesting that either the zoning ordinance or the
52:19
term sheet provide a minimum percentage of open Spa guaranteed open space within the development
52:28
proposed Building height uh the proposal is to allow buildings up to 400 feet
52:33
with design review required for buildings over 200 ft which is a pretty basic standard throughout our downtown
52:39
districts uh the proposal includes requiring a 5-ft building step back and a building must include uh one of the
52:45
following a mid block walkway uh they did not provide a minimum width for what that would need to be uh affordable
52:52
housing incentives and privately owned but publicly accessible open space within the boundaries of this District
53:00
um and that that open space would need to include a shade canopy of 60% of that open space area and then there was no uh
53:07
minimum square footage provided within that text additionally uh development over tuner feet will need to submit
53:14
plans to the FAA and take into account all recommendations to essentially just
53:20
invoid interference with the airport and aircrafts uh staff feed back on the
53:27
building height so the proposed Building height uh will ultimately be regulated
53:33
by the FFA or FAA um planning staff as well as the applicant we are working
53:39
with the airport and a consultant we haven't started it uh started working on this but we're doing a study uh to
53:46
review the impacts of future development within this area so hopefully we can have uh a little bit more details on
53:52
that for the next uh meeting with you but the study stud will be done by Thanksgiving and it will be forwarded uh
53:59
to the to the city council uh so so uh feedback on the building height regulations um we are
54:07
suggesting that the midblock walkways associated with additional Building height have a minimum width of 15 ft
54:12
which matches other zoning districts and then we are also requesting that the open space associated with the
54:18
additional Building height has a minimum square footage
54:24
requirement proposed land use um some of the proposed land uses in the ordinance don't align necessarily with the purpose
54:32
of the zoning District I have those listed uh listed below we did do some
54:37
consolidation of uh of definitions remove some land uses during this mixed
54:44
use consolidation project um and so if this ordinance is passed we will
54:50
ultimately end up modifying and making sure that the land uses uh match what in
54:56
the other land use tables but the ones on the screen um staff has reviewed and
55:02
does not believe they align with the overall purpose of the district uh proposed design standards so
55:09
the applicant is proposing design standards for both development along the periphery of the site as well as
55:17
interior uh the proposal states that the design standards would only apply to
55:22
development along Redwood Road and North Temple and then then buildings within the interior of the district where there
55:29
will be um private roads those have not been established yet but that's anticipated a lot of private road
55:35
development um would not be subject to design standards the applicant is proposing to screen mechanical equipment
55:41
and provide Street trees on the interior of the site uh staff feedback regarding
55:47
the design standards so staff is requesting to that the applicant review the plans and uh apply the design
55:55
standards to development on all public streets and along the Jordan River not just Redwood Road and North Temple and
56:03
then we also recommend adding additional standards which are um already found in
56:08
our design standards uh section of code and we are uh recommending adding
56:15
standards for lighting entry features parking garage standards and maximum length of building
56:22
facad uh the proposed signage regulations uh the proposal allows
56:28
signage that's larger than in other zoning district and sign overlay districts uh we are less concerned about
56:36
signage within the interior of the development uh but signage along public streets should match zoning districts
56:42
that have similar development intensities um a reference point could be the newly created downtown
56:48
Entertainment District that uh was just recently passed as a reference point for uh what appropriate signage could look
56:55
like and then we have the the city has really uh three main priorities right now um we
57:04
are seeking to include a minimum amount of open space uh to be provided with
57:09
either in within the zoning ordinance itself or the term sheet um the
57:15
exemption the overall exemption from the riparian corridor overlay is not supported by public utilities uh we will
57:22
be sending the applicant comments on the on the term sheet on um mitigation measures and suggestions on how to come
57:29
to a consensus on the overlay and then um design standards should apply to all public roads and the Jordan River
57:35
Frontage not just Redwood Road and North Temple so the next steps uh we're moving
57:41
quick based on the uh State timeline so the 45-day public engagement period ends
57:47
two days before we'll be back here for a public hearing on this zoning ordinance that's for you today um at that time you
57:53
will have the development agreement you'll have the term sheet to review and make a recommendation on as well um we
58:01
need to have this transmitted to the city council no later than October 30th and then in November we will hold uh
58:08
briefings with the council public hearings and the uh adoption of the
58:13
zoning ordance and development agreement will be on either December 3rd or the 10th so as I stated before an agreement
58:20
has to be reached before December 31st um or this area would not be subject to any of our zoning regulations
58:27
I'm available for questions and then the applicant is here as well thank
58:33
you so um just kind of I'm I am curious about that last
58:40
portion of if a development agreement is not um kind of figured out then by the
58:47
31st of December then nothing applies from the city um but is that just a
58:54
space for which uh one could procrastinate through uh
59:00
the developer could procrastinate through and just not to what we're asking until that like
59:08
it um Technic technically yes um but
59:13
we're working with them and we're negotiating and and reviewing um you know other sections of our ordinance and
59:20
um providing suggestions on how to um so some of this in just good faith
59:27
like um okay sorry just had to I know I
59:33
um yeah okay it's a very hard it's a very short timeline um it's a quick
59:39
turnaround and so it's it's really on us and and you know within the city to move
59:44
forward as quickly as we can with our review comments and review um periods
59:49
okay thank you so I know this is a briefing but can we also get a briefing from the applicant if they're here like
59:56
y they here and they have a presentation and I can pull that up for you it is
1:00:01
quite similar to mine but um he will'll have more information on
1:00:07
the the overall vision of the district and development agreement
1:00:13
here switch great um thank you my name is Wade budge I'm here representing the
1:00:19
land owner which is lhm Dev e which is the Larry H Miller company um we're looking forward to the and first of all
1:00:26
want to thank each of you for making time for us for this briefing um today our thoughts were to give you an
1:00:32
overview and we want to compliment staff because they've done a very good job in providing the overall construct and some
1:00:37
of the concepts we've been working with as we've begun these negotiations um our intent is to gather input from all of
1:00:43
you and continue to work continue to work with the staff to have a very fome presentation for you on the 23rd um but
1:00:50
we wanted to um first begin by just orienting you to what is our thinking
1:00:55
and Our Hope set of hopes so you can understand where we're going and then um
1:01:01
to um just address what was stated in in your question um commissioner uh CRA um our
1:01:10
thought is this that we wanted to show our good faith by making an application affirmatively um sometimes the city will
1:01:16
just go ahead and initiate its own res Zone in this instance we've gone ahead and made our own application and we've
1:01:21
been engaged and we want to really thank the staff they devoted a lot of resources and have been giving us a lot of ideas
1:01:27
and and from the timeline as we just heard October is going to be a very busy month for us we're going to be involved
1:01:33
in a lot of discussions and and um we'll be working to bring a very fome application to you all uh or fome uh
1:01:41
presentation rather to you all on the 23rd so I what I thought I'd start with is just this context map and what's
1:01:48
important and what it drives a lot of what you see here oh not a touch screen so this one's a touchcreen yeah sorry
1:01:53
okay just this way it's not just that one so what you'll see here is
1:01:58
that um the river is driving a big component of what is going on with respect to this site we've been working
1:02:05
with the division of Forestry fire and state lands which has ownership respon ownership and management responsibility
1:02:11
over the Jordan River and we're trying to balance what are their goals and initiatives along with the state
1:02:17
Fairground which has its own entity which we call the authority because otherwise we get kind of Tangled in an
1:02:23
acronym soup here we've got a distri we've got an authority we've got the city and its departments and we're and
1:02:30
then of course we have this other state entity which is sovereign state lands but as we're looking at this I wanted to
1:02:36
give you just a bit of historical context I like what you see in this image intended to be the same area but
1:02:42
in 195 couple things going on Fairgrounds were there in 1958
1:02:47
interestingly the um the KOA which is what we call it now the KOA is there in
1:02:52
some form slightly smaller um but you'll notice that there are some ball fields there I like that historic tie um those
1:02:58
are the white ball fields and while our goal is to actually locate the major
1:03:04
league facility on the other side of the river I still like that it's within a very close distance of what it was a
1:03:10
historic use and then of course the Jordan River is very prominent in this image so these are some of the things that are motivating our efforts here
1:03:17
today um as we indicated in the staff report and I may go through some of my slides rather quickly because the staff
1:03:22
did such a great job in orienting us to the overall construct um these are the areas that
1:03:28
are under the application um these represent lands we
1:03:33
own um or have under contract and then um and then we do have a city parcel
1:03:40
called out which is the city owns that little sliver on the east side of the river and then um but this is a more
1:03:46
important one and I don't think this was in the earlier presentation what this represents in purple and I hope that's
1:03:52
coming through okay on your screen this represents the boundaries of the district as identified
1:03:59
in the statue that was passed and so what this what these areas are and let
1:04:04
me just spend a moment on this what we have here is state buildings north of Redwood
1:04:09
Road um we have the natural resources building which is also north of red I mean um excuse me north of North Temple
1:04:16
as we're next to I 215 that's a state building and then as we get to the corner of Redwood Road in North Temple
1:04:22
you'll see the natural resources building and then as you go further North from there there's further State
1:04:28
lands that are owned and then you come around the bend coming down the river then you end up in the
1:04:34
fairgrounds and so a majority of these lands that you'll see here in the
1:04:39
district boundaries uh are State lands and so in that instance the state's going to
1:04:46
proceed and pursue its initiatives the way it desires but in the cont in the
1:04:51
process of negotiating this District we worked with the city and the input
1:04:57
that we received and we passed along to the state is with respect to this sizable portion of land that's at at
1:05:04
issue and we're discussing today at when it comes to that set of lands let's work
1:05:09
with Salt Lake City to make sure they retain zoning uh authority over those lands and so the intent of this exercise
1:05:16
is to come up with a an ordinance that will work for these private lands and then also make sure that we have a
1:05:23
development agreement both by the deadline and so as was indicated by staff those are two work streams that are currently
1:05:29
going on but I thought it was helpful to just Orient all of us to um this overall
1:05:34
area and um what I don't have today are for instance a series of renderings on
1:05:40
our project plan or those types of details and that really is because those have changed and morphed a lot as we've
1:05:47
gone through some discussions with various stakeholders we've involved a nationally renowned planning firm known
1:05:54
as sataki to um assist us with that planning effort of the private lands and then we've engaged Consultants who are
1:06:01
advising us on Fair Ground operations there's a who knew that there was a separate subset of Consultants on that
1:06:06
topic but there is and one of the intents is to make sure that the development that occurs on this large
1:06:13
Rocky Mountain Power parcel which we have under contract will meld in well with the kind of experiences that the
1:06:19
fairground not only offers today but is looking to offer in the future to create a a synergistic area
1:06:26
for development and for um for Community
1:06:31
use all right so this is a slightly better picture this shows how the um if
1:06:37
the zoning District as proposed were to be passed it would apply and the reason
1:06:42
I identify this is the red area which is again the application area is overlaid over the existing zoning districts and
1:06:49
what you'll see is that there's a hodgepodge of existing zoning districts and I know there's a consolidation effort that is going on separately will
1:06:55
probably be completed this year but the intent we that we brought forward with our application is to create one single
1:07:03
zone for these private lands so that we as what the what the statute calls as
1:07:09
the qualified owner meaning the owner of these 93 Acres we are able to not only
1:07:14
negotiate and process zoning applications with you all and then development applications with you but we
1:07:20
can also respond to the district which is a board that has now been set up up
1:07:26
they just hired um an executive director and they're hiring a staff and the
1:07:31
reason we need the ability to manage not only what you all um require in terms of
1:07:36
regulations but also to deal with their requirements is because they hold a great deal in terms of the financial Pur
1:07:43
strings so to speak they are pulling in tax increment and pulling in um dollars
1:07:48
from other state sources to devote to um the Improvement of this area and so we
1:07:55
want one of the things that you may see as we're D diving into this ordinance is there seems to be a lot of flexibility
1:08:00
well one of the reasons is is because we need the ability to respond to requests from this board that is will be coming
1:08:08
that's acting with their District hats on so that that's that's just a comment I wanted to get um into the discussion
1:08:15
as we're thinking over these provisions and as was indicated by um staff you
1:08:21
know the purposes of the of the ACT were to establish the board to set up Finance
1:08:26
mechanisms and Revitalize these areas and provide for coordination with State Assets in the
1:08:32
area um you know what we've done is we've taken that set of purposes and we've then put them into a format that
1:08:39
is similar not identical and certainly has some aspects that are unique um but
1:08:45
that you'll find in other zoning districts in the city and so one of the things we did is we obviously had a
1:08:50
purpose statement applicability section dealt with yard standards and Heights have a very extensive use table which
1:08:58
some of the comments I just saw for the first time and we'll take back to the client we'll talk about before our meeting on the 23rd and then we have a
1:09:04
component in here about design standards and how that would work and then sign regulations so I'm going to touch on a
1:09:10
few of these topics but I invite any of you to interrupt me at any time to ask for further clarification I don't mean
1:09:15
to just have a monologue up here so feel free to interrupt
1:09:21
um the purpose statement I think's been covered and it's in the mat materials if you ever want to look more at that and
1:09:28
also I believe the statue is in the packet so that could be looked at as well um as staff indicated there are no
1:09:34
General plans that apply just simply because we didn't want to have um a conflict and what I found is really
1:09:39
interesting here and this was actually a surprise to me is that when you're look in these if we go back a couple slides
1:09:46
I'm just going to show you what I'm talking about so you'll see how it says West South Temple that road is actually
1:09:51
not a public road it's a private road all the way through and so one of the things that's interesting here is the
1:09:58
known public roads that are very prominent and that affect this area are North Temple and Redwood Road ironically
1:10:07
South Temple is not and then there is we are working right now on a road Matrix
1:10:13
with our master plan advisers and we you know the intent would be to either dedicate those to the
1:10:20
public or or arrange for other public use but those are some of the
1:10:25
interesting items and and motivated the desire that we not have General plans apply because we didn't want to
1:10:30
something that might have been in conflict with what the board may tell us needs to happen with respect to these
1:10:35
lands and then we the staff touched on the overlay districts and um and that that's
1:10:42
intended to cover not only the riparian area was mentioned but also to cover the
1:10:47
air um FAA requirements and we want to first of all complement the staff and
1:10:54
the city because the city has been very very proactive on this item relative to
1:11:00
interfacing with the airport and the FAA we want to complement them because they've gone out and hired a consultant
1:11:05
and we've been working with them to provide data on what we see a couple of our operating assumptions are these a
1:11:11
prominent feature in this District are those Smoke Stacks we've all seen them they're 255 ft tall so we recognize that
1:11:19
at that height we're in a situation where there's an existing use and an existing height if we're going above
1:11:26
that we in new territory in terms of potential impacts in that area um as
1:11:32
when we get further into this you'll see that what we have in in in written into this is that if we were ever to propose
1:11:38
a building over 200 feet we would go through a design Rie process such as the one you all do frequently particularly
1:11:44
in the downtown districts to make sure there's the right meeting of community benefit and also architecture and other
1:11:51
items that will be conducive with the neighborhood um right now what we do know is that
1:11:57
we're focusing very much on where reserving space and I prioritizing space for the major league facility which
1:12:04
would be right there again next to the river and then we already have an office user who wants to come forward and we are we are sharing some of those very
1:12:10
preliminary Concepts on that office user and what they're looking for in terms of
1:12:15
an office building um right now that office building would be under the 200 ft but it it's good because it would
1:12:22
bring some immediate Vitality to this area and make it so that we can get moving forward with this project um
1:12:29
quickly um as was indicated by the staff we don't have um lot setback lot area
1:12:35
setback or other restrictions but of course building requirements will still apply as they would and there is a good
1:12:41
at making sure that we don't have um doors or other um impediments uh into
1:12:47
the public ways or sidewalks or drive or roads which Believe It or Not does happen in some communities but won't
1:12:54
happen here um Building height I was touching on this just a moment ago so the intent would be that if you're propos if we're
1:13:01
proposing a building 200 feet then we go through that process and this is a process you're
1:13:07
each familiar with but what's called out and I thought was worth mentioning today is making sure there's a midblock
1:13:14
walkway so that that pedestrian element is preserved and then that and another
1:13:20
option would be to have an affordable housing project um there are some affordable housing initiatives that are
1:13:27
comp that are prioritized in the bill and we'll be supportive of those but how much of those will be within the site
1:13:32
and how much will be near the site are still yet to be determined and then of course creating open space and let me just pause to make
1:13:39
a comment about open space it's true we didn't put a regulation in the draft but we do have in our negotiated purchasing
1:13:47
agreement uh a private obligation to achieve within this project area the red
1:13:52
area that I showed you between 12 and and 18% open space and the reason is is
1:13:58
because as our land planners have been advising us on how to best locate not only the street network but also to make
1:14:04
sure that you have pedestrian areas that would be able to accommodate what would be coming from a major league facility and then wanting them to get into an
1:14:10
Entertainment District we're going to have need to have sufficient open space so that those connections can occur and
1:14:19
so we hadn't wanted to hardwire that into an ordinance per se even though we had it's a private oblig just because we
1:14:26
needed that flexibility but you know as as each of you have comments I'm here to take them down bring them back to our
1:14:32
group and then you're going to see more more people at the table than just me when we're here on the
1:14:37
23rd so just wanted to touch on that while you're on that yes slide just a couple of quick questions so on on our
1:14:46
page that has the information similar to us to that which is page 32 of our um
1:14:52
report yes we have this and I just this is just a Ticky question but it says
1:14:58
buildings with less than 50% of the total facade surface clading glass are Exempted from the requirement of the
1:15:05
minimum setback um being located the step back being located above the first floor
1:15:11
there so there's all this technical stuff later on sorry the minimum glass
1:15:16
requirements are 50% and 60% so where are we looking at this below 50% glass
1:15:22
clad where where's that happening like if there 's a specific exception to the requirements for the design for the
1:15:30
glass percentages it's this one right here do you know what I'm talking about am I making any
1:15:35
sense so if you go from that page so we're looking at 3A the last sentence
1:15:41
less than 50% of the total facade and then if you go down in the tables so
1:15:47
this is on then page 38 when we're looking at the front edge
1:15:53
along Redwood Road and North Temple I guess that's where we're talking about the design standards only apply in those
1:15:58
areas so you could have buildings on the interior that don't have that much glass correct that's correct there there are
1:16:04
two sets of design standards I don't mean to interrupt but two and um two sets of design standards some apply to
1:16:10
all and that but they're more modest it's the screening it's the street trees and soil volumes the ones that that were
1:16:16
just cited um apply to Frontage along Redwood and North Temple and you're you
1:16:22
are correct you have a 60% um uh ground floor percentage
1:16:27
requirement and then there's a cross-section to existing code and then there is an upper floor glass
1:16:34
percentage and so that that's what's intended is once you get to the upper floors then it falls to 50% so wherever those design standards
1:16:41
end up applying whether they're on all public roads and and the river that's the percentages that are
1:16:48
going to apply it's it's Redwood in North Temple um I we don't have down the river
1:16:55
you're talking about I think that's just staff's recommend that's part of staff's recommendation correct that's correct
1:17:00
yeah and then another question on this page so B3 so
1:17:06
3b3 the proposal includes a privately owned publicly accessible open space on
1:17:11
the property or on another property within the geographic boundaries and I I
1:17:17
understand that paragraph at the end says ex existing public open space areas f d are not eligible for purpose of this
1:17:25
subsection but I would say we need a little more clarity there okay
1:17:31
um just I think one of the intents and I'd love your reaction to that is certainly it makes sense if there's an
1:17:37
open area which there isn't much because if you think about this area it's primarily a headquarters for
1:17:44
utility uh closed down Rada in an old closed down Trucking terminal and then
1:17:52
lay down yard for a Regional utility um so but to the extent there is
1:17:59
public open space in there we're not going to be able to double dip and claim that that's part of the dedication would qualify us as or entitle us to go after
1:18:06
over 200 fet I think the intent is that um we're going to have open space that
1:18:13
will be shown made available and that would need to be identified on an application for a particular building
1:18:18
site seeking to go more than 200 fet I think what I'm hearing is maybe when we're throwing in that concept it could
1:18:25
be other than the property that's being developed that's where it gets a little confusing okay y I think you just need some clarity on that I'll take we'll
1:18:32
make those edits and on the on the topic of open
1:18:37
space um it's great I I love that it's in your
1:18:42
PSA to have these percentages of open space I think that's great and then my
1:18:47
next question is if you're willing to do it let's just get it in the terms with the city I'll put that out there thank you I
1:18:55
agree with that too that it it would be nice to have it in the the agreement and then we all know what the definition of
1:19:01
open space is in that case and okay thank
1:19:08
you thank you for letting me interrupt and I didn't mean to interrupt do you have anything to add on that okay thanks
1:19:14
great thanks for those comments um continuing on um and then on uses um the general
1:19:21
gist if you will it's it's an extensive use of lists I extensive list of uses the intent is to again provide a a broad
1:19:29
canvas conditional is really rather narrow we only be dealing with uses we don't anticipate having there but we're
1:19:37
trying to get it right on the first instance and then there are some uses that are expressly prohibited um we'll
1:19:42
take back to our group the list that um the staff shared in their presentation
1:19:48
to see if we we shouldn't come to an agreement on some additional changes other comments on the uses table I a
1:19:54
question about um it just says short-term rentals are permitted use and I wonder if if staff maybe can say what
1:20:02
the definition of that is does that mean airbnbs or does that mean hotel motel um hotel and motel have a separate
1:20:10
definition yeah uh so it would mean airbnbs so uh the way we Define it now is less than 30 days um that being said
1:20:18
there have been some policy changes within the city's uh business licensing and maybe Nick
1:20:25
make sure I'm saying this 100% correct because it was just brought up to our staff think yesterday um I believe that
1:20:32
we are no longer permitting short-term rentals anywhere within the city so so
1:20:37
just a correction on that any zoning District that allows any sort of lodging
1:20:42
use so less than 30 days an Airbnb is allowed by zoning right
1:20:48
um the business licing is totally separate so that that's up to business licensing to figure out whether they're
1:20:53
going to license them or not but zoning allows that short-term rental in those
1:20:59
same zones where you could have hotel motel bread and breakfast Etc so and the
1:21:06
definition of short-term rentals we we recently only just added that to the ordinance right and so it doesn't in
1:21:13
this case that zoning there are other places in the city that currently allow short-term rentals yeah any any Zone
1:21:21
that allows one of those uses I mentioned we would we have allowed short-term rentals in and a zoning it
1:21:27
there exist in other places in the city places where you can have dwellings like homes and short-term rentals and hotel
1:21:34
motel bed and breakfast all of that exist in other places in our city yeah
1:21:40
so most of our um higher end mixed you zones commercial zones Etc that allow hotel and motel or Bed and Breakfast
1:21:47
also allow some a variety of residential uses and so in those zones yes you could
1:21:52
have some residential uses that are conver to Airbnb in a strict residential Zone uh any short-term rental is not
1:21:59
allowed by zoning okay if it's in a zone that allows hotel motel you also
1:22:05
short-term rentals are also allowed in homes that are built as single family
1:22:10
residences in those zones yes currently yes and here thank you and if I may just
1:22:17
for a moment our current planning doesn't show any detached um single family dwellings in within our private
1:22:22
lands at all we would have multif family attached flat stacked flats and there
1:22:28
may be room for some Town Homes at some point too um there will be however hotels we're anticipating hotels because
1:22:35
it's a very complimentary use with uh a stadium of the type we're looking to build I also feel um supportive of the
1:22:42
list that the planning staff suggested that also maybe doesn't fit in this
1:22:48
Zone and the rest of you can weigh in if you want to on that too no I agree with that as I was going through the list I
1:22:54
thought these seems very excessive okay that seems like a very strong word but
1:23:00
it seemed like I'm not I agree with the list it doesn't feel like a strong one here our chair said that better way I've
1:23:07
done a lot of projects and never one of quite this size or with as as
1:23:12
extensive so anyway this is one small note on some of the notes to the table
1:23:19
it's it referenced specifically the arena and if you're writing this for
1:23:24
Zing I get that it's anticipated there will be an arena there maybe just look at whether that's what you really want
1:23:30
to have there or if it's to reference a building I think some of it in specifically was in terms of the rooftop
1:23:37
signage if I'm remembering correctly I my thought and I'd love your reaction to this is as the staff was making its
1:23:44
presentation on the um sign component my thought is we probably need to do a a
1:23:50
clean through before we take bring this back to you because what we're doing doing there is this you know we
1:23:56
took um part of ironically a Miller initiative signed overly that was done
1:24:03
back in 2016 with Nick and others and we're taking some of those components to put
1:24:09
in that area to anticipate a stadium or Arena type use but it needs to be cleaned up in terms of making sure that
1:24:16
it works for the fact that this district has a lot else going on just not only a stadium yeah so um the footnotes and I
1:24:25
think maybe some other components might need to be cleaned up before we're back before you
1:24:31
okay great thank you um and then here again is the design standards which I
1:24:37
think we've already covered uh well we we've touched on I should say um but this talks in terms of building
1:24:44
materials ground ground floor use these are the types of things that um would need to be shown in an application to
1:24:51
have buildings fronting those public roads and then I understand that staff has asked for any public road not just
1:24:56
simply those two roads and so that's something we need to consider and if any of you has a has a anyone of you has a
1:25:03
opinion on that just let me know or let us the staff know because that's going to be on our list of things to
1:25:09
review does does ground floor use mean ground floor active use the way the way
1:25:15
we've been discussing it is that what that means thank
1:25:20
you yeah I just would definitely lean towards staff's recommendation on on
1:25:26
that um it we we in the city take a lot
1:25:32
of put a lot of emphasis in trying to construct that ground floor um
1:25:39
pedestrian oriented environment and I mean suzaki is great at doing that so they're going to do great but having it
1:25:45
in the code as a requirement um feels like if it's already going to happen
1:25:51
let's just put it in the agreement make sure that it happens okay
1:25:56
thank you for that comment and then um this is the section
1:26:01
which I think we should spend more time on when we go through the combing exercise as was just indicated but the
1:26:07
intent there is to make sure as we look for an opportunity to locate the type of
1:26:13
facility we're wanting to place right there at between South Temple and North Temple and adjacent to the river that
1:26:18
we're able to uh create the entertainment fill that you would have but you know as what you'll see in in
1:26:25
our next meeting is is that as you're moving towards the West what you're going to have is a pedestrian area but
1:26:31
then also blocks and areas for multif family office and we are really going to
1:26:37
emphasize office I know that's not necessarily A a topic that's um you know
1:26:43
see as many office applications coming in right now because of the market but where we already have an office user for
1:26:49
at least 10 stories who's wanting to come in and get moving now um we see
1:26:54
there an opportunity that's an opportunity to build some other offices right in that vicinity and the other
1:27:00
thing we of course like is that if we have an office use that works well with the parking demand for uh a stadium
1:27:07
particularly for those night games so anyway some of the topics that we're looking at and I know you've been very
1:27:13
generous to let me drone on as long as I have in this briefing I know it was intended to just be an overview but um
1:27:19
please provide to me any input and then as we go back and have our internal meetings and are starting to prepare for
1:27:24
the 23rd we'll we'll attempt to address all of your comments I have some general thoughts um
1:27:31
for you um one of the things that I do agree with is definitely some design
1:27:36
standards along the river um the river is a huge asset that the city has been
1:27:43
investing in in terms of visioning and master plans um and I I think that um
1:27:49
that's an appropriate Frontage so as far as like streets infrastructure that you
1:27:55
intend to build in this area it it may be a nice compromise that
1:28:02
if you have a major Street that's going to you know be somewhat of an arterial
1:28:08
street that that that could be one that we include in a design review okay and then if you have some side streets that
1:28:16
aren't necessarily facilitating um the type of traffic movement that say we
1:28:21
have in the city those may be exempt that's just a thought but I think the primary reason when when
1:28:27
I look at design reviews and when we have a project that has multiple Street frontages um part of
1:28:34
what you know I know that there's this this balance because you got to have like what we call the back of the
1:28:39
building right you still have to have services but I think that we are at a time where we can be a lot more
1:28:45
Innovative that the back of the building doesn't look like what it did 30 40 50 years ago um and and so I think if you
1:28:54
take that into consideration of how you're designing those buildings y
1:28:59
That's um a big part of that activation because if we have a building that has at least three major streets we can't
1:29:06
they can't have the every bit of it be active they have to have services and um
1:29:12
you know utilities and all that somewhere so um you know i' I'd be comfortable
1:29:18
with some sort of a hybrid to having every street be applicable to designer
1:29:24
review um but I think this area is so large to have nothing in the interior
1:29:29
kind of um be applicable to those d review standards is um probably won't
1:29:37
yield the best projects that you could and that might just be something you could consider but I definitely think
1:29:43
the river should be um open to some some standards the design standards um the
1:29:49
other some other comments I can't like use my glasses to see close up but I need him to see far away um one of the
1:29:57
things that I really when you look at this aerial and one of the things I hope we don't see in in this project are
1:30:03
these vast parking lots so I really hope that you're Innovative in um the parking
1:30:11
areas to utilize parking garages and in certain ways so we don't have vast areas
1:30:18
of concrete and that's right surface parking lots because that's a really
1:30:23
inefficient land let me just address that we we intend to have really no surface Park we
1:30:28
will have surface parking in an interm State while we're waiting for some development to occur but wherever there
1:30:34
will be surface our intent is to get it into a structured parking eventually so it's a wiser use of land and we're
1:30:40
trying to achieve a lot of activity in this area and we feel like that gets lost if it's just a sea of parking
1:30:47
that's exactly the truth um I also think it would be really really great if you
1:30:54
um and I don't know if this is necessarily need to be part of the agreement or whatnot but
1:31:01
um but you have two track stops servicing this area one obviously closer
1:31:07
to the potential stadium and one further down to another part of the district I I
1:31:13
really hope that your infrastructure as you design it capitalizes on that
1:31:19
pedestrian movement into and out of your District along North Temple depends on
1:31:25
it in real terms because so many of our users will be coming from that one if you don't do that you are completely
1:31:31
missing the point and and capturing that movement well if you if you don't do
1:31:38
that correct um and I think that should be a really big priority of how then
1:31:43
when you develop within your property you develop those those walkways or that
1:31:48
pedestrian movement and that flow towards your stadium and towards other parts of what you might consider an
1:31:55
Entertainment District that you um pay special attention to those um and then
1:32:02
I'm I'm also not necessarily against um a percentage of open space being
1:32:08
designated instead of it being connected to X number of parcels but I think 12%
1:32:14
is way too low you should be like 18 to 20% honestly if you want to like really
1:32:20
do it well and and these are things that make your project better make your
1:32:26
projects more amendable to people that live there the people that want to visit there um to come stay to come and enjoy
1:32:33
even when there's not a a game to come out and and utilize that area so they're entirely to your benefit um to do and I
1:32:41
kind of hope you error on the little higher percentage um for that and those
1:32:46
are like the my basic question or my basic comments is maybe you've moved
1:32:52
forward in a plan um that you know we can work with with the city and but
1:32:57
otherwise I I think the city um recommendations aren't onerous there's a
1:33:04
couple little compromises I think that are that are okay but the priorities for
1:33:09
the city I think are spot on um how we go about maybe getting those we can
1:33:15
tweak into certain hybrids but um I think that um we all want this to
1:33:20
succeed thank you that's the number one thing this is a great opportunity for this area it's a huge area and I think
1:33:28
we all want this to succeed so thank you for um coming tonight as well at the briefing and giving us an idea of what
1:33:35
you what your what your vision and your priorities are even if there aren't rendering yet so thanks
1:33:43
again um so one thing that I am really conscious of about is so I live on the
1:33:50
west side so I and um I would love to be able to engage with
1:33:57
the space be a part of the space but I also just worry about my neighbors and a
1:34:02
lot of us a lot of the neighbors rent so the the chance of displacement goes up
1:34:09
dramatically whenever we have this beautiful thing that we all want to be a part of and is incredible um and so um
1:34:18
do you have any I know that there's a consideration for um affordable housing
1:34:24
units which could offset some of that displacement conversation but um can you
1:34:31
just talk to me about like what your thoughts are on displacement in this
1:34:36
area and how um you plan to be able to try to mediate some of that that issue
1:34:44
yeah so there there it's certainly a very Dynamic issue and I don't want by my answer to think that I've addressed
1:34:51
all of the issues cuz and and and and giving short shrift to the other elements but two things that jump out at
1:34:57
me are are these one is we bringing more Supply we're intending to bring multif family Supply that will help in in
1:35:03
addressing the shortage but then importantly and this is and I credit um the city and the and the state and
1:35:09
working together the monies that are generated from this you're having depending on which lands they're
1:35:15
generated from are between 10 and 20% of the increment will be made available for affordable housing and so that is going
1:35:22
to help with respect to providing um Supply in the area some of it may be
1:35:27
within the project other will be within the vicinity and and and remember that
1:35:33
this District applies to you know areas broader than just this red area but the intent would be to be creating that
1:35:39
supply of resource that could then be used for projects that provide you know
1:35:45
80% Ami and maybe even create some opportunities for aitech and other types of which then are obviously more
1:35:52
attainable um or more affordable rather um does that
1:35:57
so if if some of that tax acement ends up creating more Supply in the
1:36:02
neighborhood um does that then follow Salt Lake City standards for um the way
1:36:10
that we deal with new development um because what I can't remember what it's
1:36:15
called but it's when you create a structure you have certain things you have to do for the population that was
1:36:22
in that location before for um what is that called just it's just the community
1:36:28
benefit maybe I have just to use of the term you might be referring to our community benefit ordinance that was
1:36:34
passed um any uh rezone General plan Amendment uh needs to address
1:36:42
displacement um yeah yeah so I guess just like when purchasing property
1:36:48
outside of this increment area um with some of that tax incentive which is
1:36:54
going to be amazing that's great news does that then fall under City standards or is that kind of back to kind of the
1:37:02
state gets to use whatever terms they want to to be able to I'll look into
1:37:07
that to get you a better answer but I want to identify one item really quickly the risk of displacement that we see in other developments isn't here with this
1:37:14
one and the reason is is if you look at the purple boundaries there's not a residence in any of them right so we're
1:37:19
not looking to remove an existing residence and then replace it with with something else and what I the other
1:37:25
reason I went back to this slide is I think there is a lot of opportunity to put these parking fields and maybe
1:37:31
underutilized or in cases of one of these buildings and a shuttered state building and putting it to a use that
1:37:38
could be fulfilling that that housing need so don't want to think I don't want you to think I've thought we've thought
1:37:44
of all the answers but we're definitely very aware of not wanting to displace people and we want to bring more Supply
1:37:52
and we are going to have a mix we're going to have a lot of rental product as part of this we also have sell in terms
1:37:57
of condo in in this as well we don't want it to all just be one class but um
1:38:03
we are excited about the affordable housing resources that are going to be made available by this project and one
1:38:09
of the reasons we want to get it going so that that revenue streams becomes more robust more quickly cool yeah um
1:38:15
that it was is new to me that some of the tax increment is going to affordable
1:38:20
housing so that's really really great news thank you for yeah making that happen for sure I'm curious to understand uh why is
1:38:29
it really this important to you that the um repair and overlay not
1:38:35
apply um we'll we'll bring forward some details our thought in drafting the way
1:38:42
we drafted it is that we're going to be bringing the stadium right next near to
1:38:48
the river and then we're going to have Plaza space and we're going to want to
1:38:53
activate and make it so that you know I don't want to call it a Riverwalk but you want to have it so people can interface with the river in Our Hope of
1:39:01
hopes you know we would I would love to see an experience where you start at the Fisher Manch and you rent your boat and
1:39:06
you go through this area and you pull out maybe over here at one of these Park areas and you have that section of the
1:39:12
river cleaned up and it's a place where anytime you someone's in town this is an experience you're going to bring everyone to go see and does that mean
1:39:20
that the riparian overlay can't work we're just trying to get give ourselves the ability to put in those kind of
1:39:25
activation sources so that people can we can have the stadium right next to it we can have some Plaza space and the rest
1:39:32
and we'll look to make sure we're not throwing out the baby with the bath water but the intent is to truly look
1:39:38
for an opportunity to make that be an active component and not just something where development kind of has turned its
1:39:45
back on this River historically and we want to be forward- facing towards the river and I don't think the riparian
1:39:51
overlay is intended to prevent that I think it's intended to protect it it's just where we're trying to have as much
1:39:56
activity in this area Our concern is we might not be there are limitations on how close you can have structures and
1:40:02
it's in tiers it's more than one tier it just depend 25 50 100 and our thought is we didn't want to end up in something
1:40:09
that might interfere with that Vision you know we're also dealing as I mentioned at the outset with div vision
1:40:14
of for Street fire and state lands now their ownership ends at the top of bank but we want to make sure there's a good
1:40:19
seamless um interface the other thing is is we we we're going to be dealing with the city regardless why because this is
1:40:28
uh an important part for Trails Network so and and if we W we're going to succeed we got to tie into the trails
1:40:33
Network and so I think the city interest will be represented I just don't know if that over that riparian overlay is the
1:40:39
best way to make it work but you know we've heard the comments and so we'll take another look yeah I it seems like
1:40:45
there's maybe a finer way to thread that needle rather than nothing or all yeah
1:40:51
I'm I'm I'm writing that down so
1:40:57
um I mean we recently unanimously kind of
1:41:05
voted against the SG proposal because we thought that it was too much of too fast and it
1:41:15
wasn't something that you could put a great amount of thought into and that we could like respond to in any real way
1:41:20
and that was for two blocks and I think that I mean I get that we're it's not the
1:41:26
same position because of the legislature and so it's just what it is but um
1:41:31
it I I have all the same concerns about that I think that I I I don't have
1:41:36
any I don't have many real specific um things like oh we should add this to the
1:41:43
draft agreement or whatever just because for all the reasons that you talked about because everything is ongoing and
1:41:48
changing and we don't know and so we don't have anything to respond to um and so
1:41:54
I mean I I don't know I I would love to
1:41:59
see at least like a math like there's no master plan it says we don't it it read to me like a list of laws that you
1:42:05
didn't have to follow there weren't any real there wasn't anything that's like oh this is what the goal is or what
1:42:11
we're doing um like at there's as written I don't see much
1:42:17
substantive difference between letting the clock run out and saying you can build literally whatever you want and
1:42:25
signing the term sheet that we're looking at right now um because I don't think there are any there's very very
1:42:32
little um about what's in there and I think that that makes sense for an actual for like for the ballpark for the
1:42:39
area around it like I think spaces like that are so unique that it's whatever
1:42:45
but then there's this enormous swath of land that we're we're just kind of
1:42:51
saying do whatever um um and I think
1:42:57
that it it seems like it is creating a a
1:43:03
separation from the city rather than something that's connected to it um like it talks about in the term sheet about
1:43:09
like um after this gets created doesn't matter what Salt Lake City like laws or
1:43:17
zoning changes happen they don't matter there so we can't respond to a kind of
1:43:23
of change in need or see that like something isn't working there and so this is how we want to guide it um it
1:43:31
what it what it reminds me of is I I go to South Lake Tahoe a lot and there's the Border there um where half the city
1:43:37
is in California and half is in Nevada and it goes from twostory um kind of
1:43:44
like wood log cabins to 13 14 story concrete boxes that are casinos and
1:43:50
parking um and I I worry that this
1:43:57
is just cart blanch for Larry H Miller's own little Vatican City in Salt Lake I
1:44:04
mean I think you're raising a good couple points let me let me address it this way um first on the SG I me I think
1:44:09
what's not the same here is this is an area where people have not historically interacted right we all have our
1:44:16
experiences expectations understanding of how the downtown fills and so I haven't studied it beyond that but I I
1:44:22
think that we have is a bit more of a an area that is new to all of us because how many of us have ever been to the
1:44:28
Rocky Mountain Power yard none of us oh wait you oh oh well fair enough
1:44:33
sorry always always have some sort of exception and it's right here thank you um but but I think it's a bit more of a
1:44:40
blank slate but to get to your point if you look at this screen what it shows is majority of the purple is an area where
1:44:47
the state is the owner and what we're trying to do is carve out the area where
1:44:53
where there's going to be still heavy City interaction and we think there's value to that even if it doesn't read as
1:45:00
regulatory as you might see otherwise in another District we think there's a lot of value to having this area land
1:45:07
prioritized for interaction with the city on an ongoing basis I mean we're anticipating significant density a lot
1:45:13
of building types and the rest we envision that the project will be made
1:45:18
better by bringing in applications and working them through with staff who deals with the City we are envisioning
1:45:24
that as we are saying that this is an area that is not exempt from zoning but
1:45:30
rather it has the City Zoning apply it will be able to address those things
1:45:35
that even if they don't make it all into the ordinance you're going to have something that is going to correlate well with the way the city is trying to
1:45:42
program the rest of North Temple or red Red Road and I I think for that even though it maybe isn't as extensive as
1:45:48
you might otherwise prefer to see we're trying to find that happy goldilock medium if you will where you have
1:45:55
principles put into code that would apply to this area and would say that this area will continue to be regulated
1:46:01
by the city and will be coming forward and bringing the applications and and seeking the approvals versus the other
1:46:08
areas where you know those are exempt as right now may not be a
1:46:13
completely satisfactory answer but it's something that we're striving to to I to
1:46:19
me it reads more as a a confirmation of not having to follow the rules rather
1:46:24
than actually trying to create rules or guidelines or whatever um I so it it yes
1:46:32
it means that you're going through the city but it also says in there that like the city has to approve your site plan
1:46:38
and has to do it in 10 days I think um and you you know you further things
1:46:44
don't apply I don't know it just it seems very much about what what you that you can do kind of
1:46:50
anything um and so I I I don't see the the vision I worry about that CU I mean
1:46:56
there's always and these there's always a balance between like we don't know what will get built
1:47:03
in something right and so we have to weigh both the like legislative like how we can actually codify something to get
1:47:11
what we want and the vision people often come in with with renderings and with things and they look great but if
1:47:18
there's nothing there that makes that happen and here we don't even have that um we don't even have kind of an overall
1:47:25
like there's there's what could be a layout for a master plan but it's changing and yeah I don't know I I like
1:47:33
I said I understand that it's it's a function of the legislature and how it's set up and that it's not easily fixed
1:47:40
but that that's my worry for that is that this creates its own little island that separates itself out rather than
1:47:47
connecting to um and the other thing one thing that I do think shouldn't be in
1:47:53
the zoning is um it's written that uh any property can will get changed if
1:48:01
Larry Miller buys it and it's next door so it seems like a poor decision to for
1:48:09
me to say that as long as they can purchase the property next door that
1:48:14
then it spreads and it kind of grows and becomes as big as as they can purchase
1:48:20
um I think that if if we're doing if we're creating this District we should set the boundaries of
1:48:27
it at the very least gotcha thank you I feel really supportive of the um
1:48:35
there was a slide that had the main city priorities and I think there were three of them and I feel really supportive of those priorities um we've made decisions
1:48:43
in the past about people's private property and how the riparian corridor interacts with that and it seems
1:48:49
like um we weren't we we did it for a reason and probably I feel like the
1:48:55
repairing Corridor overlay should should up you know count here too I to be clear
1:49:04
properties that are owned by the state are not subject to City voting zoning
1:49:09
correct rules right now and they won't be going forward correct regardless of what agreement is made here correct okay
1:49:16
and that's and you're saying that's a significant portion of this purple area which is where it would where this
1:49:22
agreement would happen um so I I kind of I feel a little
1:49:29
concerned about the um the creep of the you know the Border creep um if if that
1:49:35
exists that buying more property makes it a bigger area um and I'm really supportive of those primary city
1:49:43
priorities okay anybody else want to toss in your
1:49:49
last few cents yeah I have a couple of other things um one is uh I mean this to to
1:50:00
build on what commissioner Scott was saying this is rezoning so we don't even
1:50:05
need to be looking at or considering plans because we are essentially creating an island with this other
1:50:12
zoning um and these rights will be now attached to that land regardless of who
1:50:17
owns it Larry Miller has a great I mean Larry Miller companies have a great track record we love that and hope that
1:50:24
that continues but this is going to be then attached to that land and so I think that's part of why everybody wants
1:50:30
to be so careful this way on the term sheet I I just have
1:50:36
a question on the um 2015 easement the
1:50:41
term sheet specifies that the easement will be terminated as part of the in the MDA itself and that there will be anou
1:50:48
for alternative easement access that you know from a city
1:50:54
perspective that just seems um problematic to me I don't want to
1:50:59
terminate you know an easement and then uh be waiting on an un enforceable mou I
1:51:06
would say if you can negotiate something there so that you're terminating and granting at the same time that would be
1:51:13
better great thank you um so if you could look at that um and then I get the
1:51:22
the you know not requiring the dedication of open space as part of an approval but maybe if you could look
1:51:29
at whe you know whether it's required or whether you voluntarily put it in the MDA but some kinds of public easements
1:51:37
over publicly owned or privately owned open space I would just hate to see you
1:51:43
know 20 30 whatever years down the road there be all of this privately owned
1:51:49
space that for whatever reason that we don't foresee right now somebody starts
1:51:54
blocking public access to so I get that you don't want maybe a public dedication
1:52:00
in full but some kind of public easement to ensure that the public has access rights
1:52:08
um I think would would be something to consider gotcha thank you
1:52:16
yeah thank you thanks all for your time tonight you look forward to seeing you two weeks you very much much for your
1:52:23
presentation Roman okay that is the end of our agenda
1:52:29
so I'm going to close this meeting thanks for coming adjourn
